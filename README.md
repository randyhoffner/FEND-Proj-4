#Website Optimization Project Live Site
The objective of this project is to optimize Cameron Pittman's Portfolio website.  There are three parts to this project.  The first task is to optimize the overall website for a PageSpeed score of at least 90 on both Mobile and Desktop by removing the rendering blocks.  The second task is to remove jank from the website-within-a- website, the pizzeria section, which is initiated with pizza.html. The third task is to optimize the code such that the time to resize pizzas is less than 5ms.

This repo contains only the fully optimized code contained in the dist folder of the master branch.
